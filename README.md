# Flutter Jakarta Talks

We want Flutter Jakarta to be a place for Flutter enthusiasts to share knowledge on Flutter development. This repository is intended as a talk archive and a place to submit talk proposals for anyone who wants to be a speaker at our meetups. We usually hold meetups in the last week of every month (if possible).

## Submit Your Talks Proposal

Please submit your talk proposal by creating a GitHub Issue. You have 30 minutes to present, and make sure that your talk proposal includes the following information:

- Talk Title
- Target Audience
- Abstract
- Outline
- Speaker Bio
- Contact

## How Talks Are Selected

There will be 2 speakers in each meetup, and we will chose talks based on a theme or a similar target audience. We want this community to be a warm and comfortable place for you to share. We will contact you via GitHub or alternative information you have provided.
